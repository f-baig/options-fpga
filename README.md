# options-fpga

pricing options using FPGAs

although the code is not on the github as of right now due to us working on it on my friends computer solely as we only have one fpga... it is coming soon we promise! this project is being worked on by my friend Nathan and I

**as a general outline of what we are doing here please take a look at the image in the repo which shows the project architecture**
